<h2>🌹 Rose Day</h2>

<div class="letter">
<p>My Lokiiii 🤍,

Today is Rose Day, but honestly, no rose can match you.
A rose has thorns, but loving you has only taught me patience and warmth.
Every time I smile thinking of you, it feels like a rose blooming inside me.
You entered my life so softly, yet changed everything so deeply.
I never knew love could feel calm and powerful at the same time.
With you, even silence feels meaningful.
Your presence makes my ordinary days feel special.
I don’t need grand gestures; your small care is enough for me.
If love had a color, it would be the shade of comfort you give me.
I promise to water this love every day with honesty and trust.
Like a rose that grows slowly, my love for you grew without me noticing.
Now it’s everywhere — in my thoughts, my dreams, my prayers.
No matter what life brings, I’ll choose you again and again.
This rose is not just a flower, it’s my heart in your hands.
Happy Rose Day, my forever 🌹

— Yours, Kirthiga ❤️</p>

<div class="letter">
<p>My Love,

If I could go back to the day I met you, I’d still choose you.
So today, on Propose Day, I want to say this clearly and truly.
I choose you — not just in happiness, but in every phase of life.
I choose your flaws, your silence, your dreams, your fears.
Being with you feels like coming home after a long day.
You understand me in ways I never explain.
You support me even when I doubt myself.That itself is love beyond words.
I don’t promise a perfect life, but I promise a loyal heart.
I promise to stand beside you, not behind or ahead.
I want to grow with you, learn with you, fight with you, heal with you.
You are not just someone I love, you are someone I respect deeply.
So here I am, with all my heart.
Will you walk this journey with me?
Not just today, but forever 💍

— Always yours, Kirthiga 💖</p>

<p>My Sweetest Lokiiii,

They say chocolates are sweet, but they clearly haven’t met you.
You add sweetness to my life without even trying.
Every laugh of yours feels like comfort food for my soul.
When I feel low, just thinking of you lifts me up.
You’re my stress reliever, my happy thought, my safe place.
Love with you doesn’t feel heavy — it feels warm and reassuring.
You never force love; you let it flow naturally.
That’s what makes you special to me.Like chocolate melts slowly, my heart melts for you every day.
You don’t just make me happy, you make me feel secure.
With you, love feels balanced and real.
I want to share all my sweetness and bitterness only with you.
Because even bitter moments feel lighter when you’re with me.
Thank you for being my comfort.

<p>My Hug, My Home,

A teddy is something you hold close, and that’s exactly what you are to me.
You are my emotional support when the world feels too loud.
Your presence calms my chaos.

Whenever I’m tired, I imagine resting in your arms.
That thought alone gives me strength.
You don’t judge my moods, you understand them.
You accept me as I am, and that means everything.
Love with you feels safe, not scary.
I don’t fear being myself around you.
You are my comfort in human form.If I ever feel lost, I know where to come back.
Holding you feels like holding peace.

<div class="letter">
<p>My Love,

A kiss is not just lips touching; it’s souls meeting.
Every kiss I imagine with you is filled with emotion.
It’s trust, closeness, and affection combined.
It’s saying “I’m here” without words.
I don’t crave moments; I crave connection with you.
I want kisses that speak comfort and reassurance.
Kisses that say “we’re okay.”
With you, intimacy feels meaningful, not rushed.
I want slow moments, real moments, honest moments.
You make love feel pure and deep.Every kiss with you would carry my heart in it.
It would say everything I feel but can’t always say.
You are my chosen person.
Today and always.
Happy Kiss Day 💋
